        >GNU/Linux Users Group (GLUG)</a
      > is a community dedicated to promoting and supporting Swatantra Software.
      GLUGs bring together enthusiasts, developers, and advocates to share knowledge,
      collaborate on projects, and spread awareness about free and open-source software.
      Without a central authority, the GNU/Linux movement relies on local groups
      like Mumbai GLUG to drive advocacy, education, and user supportâ€”empowering
      individuals to take control of their computing.
